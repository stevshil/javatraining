# Notes on Eclipse

To use the existing projects you must first have your own Workspace created.  For this course a Java workspace will suffice.

Once you have your Workspace you need to import a project:
* File
* Import
	* Tick the copy project if you want to copy it into your workspace
* General
* Existing Projects into Workspace

Then you can start to work.
